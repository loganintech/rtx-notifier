# RTX-Notifier

If you've stumbled here you're as frustrated as I am that the RTX cards are pretty impossible to buy. This program will monitor some retail sites and if one is found to have an RTX available, will open the page in your web browser.

The config format is self explanitory, but make sure to rename it to `config.json` from `example_config.json`.

If you leave out any twilio or imap credentials the bot will only perform scraping and opening the web pages on Mac or Windows.

If you want to contribute I welcome merge requests.
